            I am proficient in building full-scale websites using React and Ruby
            on Rails. I'm a full-stack, junior level developer with a preference
            towards the front-end. At the top-right of this segment there is a
            link where you can download and view my resume. Included on this
            page is a collection of personal projects that I've worked on
            recently, which is consistently being updated with new content, as
            well as a contact section if you would like to contact me.

            Since the moment I delved into the world of computers by learning to
            customize MySpace themes as a child, a fascination with computer
            science has stayed with me, and now that passion carries me through
            every project I get to work on.
          </p>
          <p>
            When my eyes aren't glued to a computer screen, you can find me
            outside rock climbing, hiking, gardening, or in the garage working
            on my latest wood working project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Technologies which I use daily include React.js, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS,
            JavaScript, Linux, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, VSCode, Ubuntu, Github, and
            Netlify.
